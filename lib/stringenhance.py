#NOTE: according to Yandex's API's doc., you need to convert special chars into escape sequences.
#However, the result of Yandex's spell check field (<text> in XML) is ASCII (bug?), not UTF8.. So, we don't make
#the conversion simply because it doesn't matter for us.
#What this means is: any UTF8 char in your text will be rounded to ASCII if a suggestion is made by Yandex.
#Unfortunately nothing can be done about it, since it is an API issue.
